<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Homeu Group respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information.</p>
<p>This is our privacy policy and we will comply with it, as well as applicable U.S. privacy law, when we gather and use information from users of the Services. We encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand what we do with the information we collect from you.</p>
<div class="zsg-content-component"></div>
<h5>Advertising-Supported Business Model</h5>
<p>The Services and our extensive set of features are generally funded through advertising dollars. <br>This advertising <a href="/corp/About.htm">revenue</a> helps keep Homeu Group free of charge for our personal user community. It also allows us to explore and build new features.</p>
<p>We strive to make advertisements relevant and useful to you. Therefore, we may serve advertisements to you based on the information we collect from you or in relation to your interaction with the Services.</p>
<p>We pledge to be transparent about the information we monitor and collect from you. We keep information private between you and Homeu Group, except as explained below.</p>
<div class="zsg-content-component"></div>
<h5>Collection of Information</h5>
<p>When you use the Services, we collect a variety of information.</p>
<ul class="zsg-list_square">
<li>
<p><strong>Information you provide.</strong> When using the Services, you may provide information about yourself, such as name, address, phone number, email and details around a potential transaction. This may occur, for example, when you register on the Services, claim a home, correspond with a real estate agent via the Services, or complete other forms, such as a loan request. You may also provide information about a third party through the Services, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email.&nbsp;We may combine this information with other information we collect from your interaction with the Services or from other companies.</p>
<p>In addition, when you order products or services through the Services, Homeu Group may collect your credit/debit card information. This information is secured using industry-standard encryption technology. Homeu Group will use this information solely to complete your order and will not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the order or comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>In the event that a credit report is required to use a Service, Homeu Group may collect your Social Security number ("SSN"). This information is secured using industry-standard encryption technology. Homeu Group restricts access to SSNs to employees, vendors and subcontractors who require SSNs to support certain products and services. Homeu Group strives to protect SSNs from unlawful disclosure and to keep them confidential by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable state and federal regulations.</p>

<h5>Usage and Disclosure</h5>
<p>In general, Homeu Group uses the information collected from you to communicate with you and operate our Services. Homeu Group also uses this information to respond to your requests and present you with advertising that we believe will be of interest or useful to you.</p>
<p>Your privacy is important and we are committed to protecting information that identifies you personally, where you have chosen to keep it private ("Personal Information"). We will only share Personal Information that you provide outside the public areas of the Services in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="zsg-list_square">
<li><strong>Consent.</strong> When you consent or direct Homeu&nbsp;Group&nbsp;to share the Personal Information. For example, if you&nbsp;choose to contact a real estate agent or lender through the Services, your name and email address will appear to the recipient of the message.</li>
<li><strong>Service providers to Homeu&nbsp;Group.</strong>&nbsp;When Homeu&nbsp;Group&nbsp;hires a service provider to help operate the Services&nbsp;or our business, Homeu&nbsp;Group&nbsp;may give access to Personal Information only as necessary to perform&nbsp;the service for Homeu&nbsp;Group, and subject to the terms of this privacy policy.</li>
<li><strong>Partners with whom we conduct business</strong>. &nbsp;Homeu&nbsp;Group&nbsp;may give business partners access to Personal&nbsp;Information only as necessary to offer products and services with those business partners, and subject to the terms of this privacy policy</li>
<li><strong>Legal obligation or protection from harm.</strong> When Homeu&nbsp;Group&nbsp;has a good faith belief that access, use,&nbsp;preservation or disclosure of the Personal Information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any requirement of law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce or investigate a potential violation of the Terms of Use, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise respond to fraud, security or technical concerns, (d) support auditing and compliance functions, or (e) protect the rights, property, or safety of Homeu Group, its users, or the public against harm.</li>

Personal Information may be transferred along with the business.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you provide public information without identifying yourself, we will protect your personal identity as described above. If your account profile does not identify you personally, Homeu Group won't reveal your identity to third parties except in accordance with this policy.&nbsp;You should keep in mind that the information that you choose to provide in a public area of the Services (such as your profile page or the discussion forums) will not be protected by this privacy policy because you have made an active choice to make that information public. &nbsp;We are not responsible for any Personal Information you choose to submit in any public area of the Services.</p>
<p>When we deliver ads based on data about your use of the Services, we keep your identity anonymous. We won't identify you personally to third parties, except in accordance with this privacy policy. Of course, if you choose to respond to an advertised offer with your name and contact information, you will no longer be anonymous to the advertiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, while we do not share your Personal Information with third parties unless permitted above, Homeu Group may share aggregate anonymous information with third-parties. This information does not personally identify individuals, but instead provides a helpful understanding of the groups of people who prefer certain types of information and services.</p>
<div class="zsg-content-component"></div>
<h5>Real Estate Information</h5>
<p>Homeu Group strives to provide open and transparent information about real estate markets. For example, we make available past sales prices for homes, and allow any user to post a question or answer about a given home. Many times, this information is already publicly available. As long as discussion surrounds real estate and not individuals, we intend to keep this information freely available through the Services. Where a professional participates in the Homeu Group communities, we may also allow users to comment on the professional, such as the lender ratings in Homeu Mortgages.</p>
<div class="zsg-content-component"></div>
<h5>Email Management</h5>
<p>You may receive email from Homeu Group for a variety of reasons - for example, if you took an action through the Services, you signed up for a regular report, or you posted your home for sale and a buyer sent you a message. We respect your desire to manage email correspondence. If you have an account with Homeu Group, you can select your preferences through your account settings. Also, you can manage your receipt of some types of communication by following the instructions included in the email we send you.&nbsp;Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from certain email correspondences, we may still need to email you with important transactional or administrative information.</p>

<p>We may participate in behavioral advertising. This means that, for example, when you use the Services, we or third party service providers or advertisers may use cookies (that they collect or that we provide to them) or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services (including mobile applications) or your online activities over time and across different Web sites and devices. Collected information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, and the Web site that referred you to the Services, and this information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier, or Internet Protocol address. These practices help tailor advertisements that are relevant and useful to you. These tailored advertisements may appear on the Services or on other websites, applications or properties.&nbsp;</p>
